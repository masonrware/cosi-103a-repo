### Description

This project is an enhancement on the schedule building app we have been demoing in class. In our additions, you can find an updated way of passing the times of a course through its routes. You will also find an updated option to search by keyword and a change to schedule.ejs

### Program Structure

This project is structured as a standard webpage written using EJS. It has a `models` subdir for all data templates, a `public` subdir for all static components, a `routes` subdir for authentication and a `views` subdir for the renderable front end files. Outside of these subdirs, the `app.js` file is the heart of the site.

### Dependencies

All dependencies can be installed with the command `npm install`.
